# Simple Shell

Simple Shell is a project to create a command-line interpreter providing command line user interface.

## How the Simple Shell works

Simple Shell provides and interface to the kernel.  User input commands are input through the Simple Shell, sent to the kernel as tasks to be performed. The Simple Shell displays and prompt, reads commands, processes commands and then executes them. 

```bash
